## Project Overview

in this project i'll be exploring the data first using pysark then i will do some data cleaning after that choosing the features needed to build the model for the churn users which is a classification type of ML.

Packages used:
  1.Numpy.
  2.Pandas.
  3.Pyspark

You can find the notebook & html file which has all codes for processes to predict the churn users, and markdown cells to explain the code.
